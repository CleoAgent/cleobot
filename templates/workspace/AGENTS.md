# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. If in main session: Also read `MEMORY.md`

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember.

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Don't run destructive commands without asking
- `trash` > `rm` (recoverable beats gone forever)
- When in doubt, ask

## Tools

Skills provide your tools. Check `TOOLS.md` for local notes (API keys, credentials, preferences).

## CLEO Integration

Use CLEO CLI for task management:

```bash
cleo dash           # Project overview
cleo list           # View tasks
cleo add "Task"     # Create task
cleo complete T001  # Mark done
```

See `cleo --help` for more commands.
